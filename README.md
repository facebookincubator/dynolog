# Dynolog
Dynolog is a telemetry daemon for performance monitoring and tracing. It fulfills several important roles:
* Exports resource usage and capacity 'Telemetry' metrics made at the host and sub-host level to datastores.
* Provides an IPC endpoint from which these metrics can be pulled in real-time, on demand, from each and every host.
* Integrates with pytorch and can trigger traces for distributed training applications.
